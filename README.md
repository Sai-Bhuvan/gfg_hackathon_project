 -> budgetX is a software tool designed to help users manage their finances by tracking their expenses and income. The main problem that your budget manager aims to solve is the difficulty that many people have in keeping track of their spending and saving habits. By providing a centralized platform for users to input their financial data, your budget manager can help users gain a better understanding of their financial situation and make informed decisions about how to manage their money.

  To achieve this goal, your budget manager utilizes MongoDB to store historical transactions for a month. This allows users to see their spending patterns over time and track their progress toward financial goals. By using a NoSQL database like MongoDB, your budget manager can handle large amounts of data efficiently and with minimal overhead.

  One of the key features of your budget manager is its ability to show users their savings over time. By analyzing historical transaction data, the software can calculate how much money users have saved over a given period and provide insights into ways to improve savings. This can help users identify areas where they can cut back on expenses and find new opportunities to save money.


 -> budget X has another useful feature in the form of an investometer. The investometer calculates various financial metrics, including simple interest, compound interest, and EMI per month.

  Simple interest refers to the interest earned on an initial investment amount, whereas compound interest refers to the interest earned on both the initial investment amount and any accumulated interest over time. The ability to calculate both of these types of interest can help users make informed decisions about where to invest their money.

  EMI, or Equated Monthly Installment, is a fixed payment made by a borrower to a lender at a specified date each month. It typically includes both principal and interest payments and is used to repay a loan over a fixed period of time. By calculating the EMI per month, the investometer can help users plan their monthly budgets and ensure they have the necessary funds to make their loan payments.

  Overall, the investometer is a valuable tool that can help users better understand the financial implications of different investment and loan options. By providing clear and accurate calculations of key financial metrics, your budget manager can help users make more informed decisions about how to manage their money and achieve their financialÂ goals.
  
  
->  Project Objective
  The main objective of your budget manager project is to provide a comprehensive solution for managing personal finances. This includes helping users track their expenses and income, analyze their spending patterns, and make informed decisions about how to manage their money.

-> Methadology
  The methodology for developing your budget manager project would likely involve several key steps, including:

  Defining requirements: The first step in any software development project is to define the requirements of the system. This involves identifying the needs of your target audience, determining the features and functionality that will be required to meet those needs, and outlining any technical constraints or considerations.

  Design and prototyping: Once the requirements have been defined, the next step is to design the user interface and user experience of your budget manager. This may involve creating wireframes or prototypes to help visualize the system and ensure that it meets the needs of your target audience.

  Development and testing: With the design and prototyping complete, the development team can begin coding the system. This involves writing the code that will power the budget manager, testing it thoroughly to identify and fix any bugs or errors, and integrating it with any necessary third-party systems or tools.

  Deployment and maintenance: Once the system has been fully developed and tested, it can be deployed to production servers and made available to users. Ongoing maintenance and support will be required to ensure that the system remains stable and secure over time.

  Throughout the development process, it is important to engage with stakeholders and solicit feedback to ensure that the project is meeting its objectives and delivering value to users. This may involve conducting user surveys or focus groups, analyzing usage data, and incorporating user feedback into future updates and iterations of the system.
